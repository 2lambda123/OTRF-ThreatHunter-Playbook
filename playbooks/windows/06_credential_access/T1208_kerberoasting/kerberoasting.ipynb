    "1. The account requesting the service ticket isn't a `machine($)` account\n",
    "2. The service ticket name they are trying to get access to typeicaly isnt going to be the `krbtgt` account or a `machine ($)` account \n",

    "    either gets us to the account that the advesary was using or limits down the results to where you can pick out the false positives to find the advesary easier. In a real enviroment this would have to be tailored to fit the enviroments paramenters and needs to better specifiy th query, but this sets a good baseline. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Another good alternative, is to see how many service tickets were pulled in a given time frame. Alot of advesaries won't do `targeted` attacks. They will just pull as many as they can. \n",
    "* Setting a `canary` account is good as well. This is a fake account that is meant to give some insight on attacks. It isn't linked to any services, so if this `canary` account is requested to give a service ticket, we know that an advesary is trying to pull these down. \n",
