## Hypothesis
Adversaries might be leveraging WMI ActiveScriptEventConsumers remotely to move laterally in my network.


## Technical Context
One of the components of an Event subscription is the event consumer. It is basically the main action that gets executed when a filter triggers (i.e. monitor for authentication events. if one occurs. trigger the consumer).

According to [MS Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/standard-consumer-classes), there are several WMI consumer classes available

* ActiveScriptEventConsumer -> Executes a predefined script in an arbitrary scripting language when an event is delivered to it. Example -> [Running a Script Based on an Event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/running-a-script-based-on-an-event)
* CommandLineEventConsumer -> Launches an arbitrary process in the local system context when an event is delivered to it. Example -> [Running a Program from the Command Line Based on an Event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/running-a-program-from-the-command-line-based-on-an-event)
* LogFileEventConsumer -> Writes customized strings to a text log file when events are delivered to it. Example -> [Writing to a Log File Based on an Event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/writing-to-a-log-file-based-on-an-event)
* NTEventLogEventConsumer -> Logs a specific Message to the Windows event log when an event is delivered to it. Example -> [Logging to NT Event Log Based on an Event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/logging-to-nt-event-log-based-on-an-event)
* ScriptingStandardConsumerSetting 	Provides registration data common to all instances of the ActiveScriptEventConsumer class.
* SMTPEventConsumer 	Sends an email Message using SMTP each time an event is delivered to it. Example -> [Sending Email Based on an Event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/sending-e-mail-based-on-an-event)

The ActiveScriptEventConsumer class allows for the execution of scripting code from either JScript or VBScript engines. Finally, the WMI script host process is `%SystemRoot%\system32\wbem\scrcons.exe`.


## Offensive Tradecraft
Threat actors can achieve remote code execution by using WMI event subscriptions. Normally, a permanent WMI event subscription is designed to persist and respond to certain events.
According to [Matt Graeber](https://twitter.com/mattifestation), if an attacker wanted to execute a single payload however, the respective event consumer would just need to delete its corresponding event filter, consumer, and filter to consumer binding.
The advantage of this technique is that the payload runs as SYSTEM, and it avoids having a payload be displayed in plaintext in the presence of command line auditing.

## Analytics


### Initialize Analytics Engine

```python
from openhunt.mordorutils import *
spark = get_spark()
```

### Download & Process Security Dataset

```python
sd_file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OTRF/Security-Datasets/master/datasets/atomic/windows/lateral_movement/host/covenant_wmi_remote_event_subscription_ActiveScriptEventConsumers.zip"
registerMordorSQLTable(spark, sd_file, "sdTable")
```

### Analytic I
Look for the creation of Event consumers of script type.



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| WMI object | Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | User created Wmi consumer | 20 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT EventID, EventType
FROM sdTable
WHERE Channel = 'Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational'
  AND EventID = 20
  AND LOWER(Message) Like '%type: script%'
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic II
Look for the creation of Event consumers of script type (i.e vbscript).



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| WMI object | Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational | Wmi subscription created | 5861 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT EventID, SourceName
FROM sdTable
WHERE Channel = 'Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational'
  AND EventID = 5861
  AND LOWER(Message) LIKE '%scriptingengine = "vbscript"%'
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic III
Look for any indicators that the WMI script host process %SystemRoot%\system32\wbem\scrcons.exe is created. This is created by svchost.exe.



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| Process | Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | Process created Process | 1 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT ParentImage, Image, CommandLine, ProcessId, ProcessGuid
FROM sdTable
WHERE Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
    AND EventID = 1
    AND Image LIKE '%scrcons%'
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic IV
Look for any indicators that the WMI script host process %SystemRoot%\system32\wbem\scrcons.exe is created. This is created by svchost.exe.



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| Process | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | Process created Process | 4688 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT ParentProcessName, NewProcessName, CommandLine, NewProcessId
FROM sdTable
WHERE LOWER(Channel) = "security"
    AND EventID = 4688
    AND NewProcessName LIKE '%scrcons%'
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic V
Look for any indicators that the WMI script host process %SystemRoot%\system32\wbem\scrcons.exe is being used. You can do this by looking for a few modules being loaded by a process.



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| Module | Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | Process loaded Dll | 7 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT Image, ImageLoaded, Description, ProcessGuid
FROM sdTable
WHERE Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
    AND EventID = 7
    AND LOWER(ImageLoaded) IN (
        'c:\\\windows\\\system32\\\wbem\\\scrcons.exe',
        'c:\\\windows\\\system32\\\\vbscript.dll',
        'c:\\\windows\\\system32\\\wbem\\\wbemdisp.dll',
        'c:\\\windows\\\system32\\\wshom.ocx',
        'c:\\\windows\\\system32\\\scrrun.dll'
    )
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic VI
Look for any indicators that the WMI script host process %SystemRoot%\system32\wbem\scrcons.exe is being used and add some context to it that might not be normal in your environment. You can add network connections context to look for any scrcons.exe reaching out to external hosts over the network.



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| Process | Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | Process created Process | 1 |
| Process | Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | Process connected to Ip | 3 |
| Module | Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | Process loaded Dll | 7 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT d.`@timestamp`, c.Image, d.DestinationIp, d.ProcessId
FROM sdTable d
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT b.ImageLoaded, a.CommandLine, b.ProcessGuid, a.Image
    FROM sdTable b
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT ProcessGuid, CommandLine, Image
        FROM sdTable
        WHERE Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
            AND EventID = 1
            AND Image LIKE '%scrcons.exe'
        ) a
    ON b.ProcessGuid = a.ProcessGuid
    WHERE b.Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
        AND b.EventID = 7
        AND LOWER(b.ImageLoaded) IN (
            'c:\\\windows\\\system32\\\wbem\\\scrcons.exe',
            'c:\\\windows\\\system32\\\\vbscript.dll',
            'c:\\\windows\\\system32\\\wbem\\\wbemdisp.dll',
            'c:\\\windows\\\system32\\\wshom.ocx',
            'c:\\\windows\\\system32\\\scrrun.dll'
        )
) c
ON d.ProcessGuid = c.ProcessGuid
WHERE d.Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
    AND d.EventID = 3
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic VII
One of the main goals is to find context that could tell us that scrcons.exe was used over the network (Lateral Movement). One way would be to add a network logon session as context to some of the previous events.



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| Process | Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | Process created Process | 1 |
| Module | Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | Process loaded Dll | 7 |
| Authentication log | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | User authenticated Host | 4624 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT d.`@timestamp`, d.TargetUserName, c.Image, c.ProcessId
FROM sdTable d
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT b.ImageLoaded, a.CommandLine, b.ProcessGuid, a.Image, b.ProcessId
    FROM sdTable b
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT ProcessGuid, CommandLine, Image
        FROM sdTable
        WHERE Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
            AND EventID = 1
            AND Image LIKE '%scrcons.exe'
        ) a
    ON b.ProcessGuid = a.ProcessGuid
    WHERE b.Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
        AND b.EventID = 7
        AND LOWER(b.ImageLoaded) IN (
            'c:\\\windows\\\system32\\\wbem\\\scrcons.exe',
            'c:\\\windows\\\system32\\\\vbscript.dll',
            'c:\\\windows\\\system32\\\wbem\\\wbemdisp.dll',
            'c:\\\windows\\\system32\\\wshom.ocx',
            'c:\\\windows\\\system32\\\scrrun.dll'
        )
) c
ON split(d.ProcessId, '0x')[1] = LOWER(hex(CAST(c.ProcessId as INT)))
WHERE LOWER(d.Channel) = "security"
    AND d.EventID = 4624
    AND d.LogonType = 3
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic VIII
One of the main goals is to find context that could tell us that scrcons.exe was used over the network (Lateral Movement). One way would be to add a network logon session as context to some of the previous events.



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| Authentication log | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | User authenticated Host | 4624 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, TargetUserName,ImpersonationLevel, LogonType, ProcessName
FROM sdTable
WHERE LOWER(Channel) = "security"
    AND EventID = 4624
    AND LogonType = 3
    AND ProcessName LIKE '%scrcons.exe'
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

## Hunter Notes
* Baseline your environment to identify normal activity. Apparently, SCCM leverages WMI event subscriptions.
