## Hypothesis
Adversaries might be leveraging PowerShell to execute code within my environment


## Technical Context
None


## Offensive Tradecraft
Adversaries can use PowerShell to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code.
Therefore, it is important to understand the basic artifacts left when PowerShell is used in your environment.

## Analytics


### Initialize Analytics Engine

```python
from openhunt.mordorutils import *
spark = get_spark()
```

### Download & Process Security Dataset

```python
sd_file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OTRF/Security-Datasets/master/datasets/atomic/windows/execution/host/empire_launcher_vbs.zip"
registerMordorSQLTable(spark, sd_file, "sdTable")
```

### Analytic I
Within the classic PowerShell log, event ID 400 indicates when a new PowerShell host process has started. You can filter on powershell.exe as a host application if you want to or leave it without a filter to capture every single PowerShell host



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| Powershell | Windows PowerShell | Application host started | 400 |
| Powershell | Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational | User started Application host | 4103 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, Hostname, Channel
FROM sdTable
WHERE (Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational" OR Channel = "Windows PowerShell")
    AND (EventID = 400 OR EventID = 4103)
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic II
Looking for non-interactive powershell session might be a sign of PowerShell being executed by another application in the background



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| Process | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | Process created Process | 4688 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, Hostname, NewProcessName, ParentProcessName
FROM sdTable
WHERE LOWER(Channel) = "security"
    AND EventID = 4688
    AND NewProcessName LIKE "%powershell.exe"
    AND NOT ParentProcessName LIKE "%explorer.exe"
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic III
Looking for non-interactive powershell session might be a sign of PowerShell being executed by another application in the background



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| Process | Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | Process created Process | 1 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, Hostname, Image, ParentImage
FROM sdTable
WHERE Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
    AND EventID = 1
    AND Image LIKE "%powershell.exe"
    AND NOT ParentImage LIKE "%explorer.exe"
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic IV
Monitor for processes loading PowerShell DLL *system.management.automation*



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| Module | Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | Process loaded Dll | 7 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, Hostname, Image, ImageLoaded
FROM sdTable
WHERE Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
    AND EventID = 7
    AND (lower(Description) = "system.management.automation" OR lower(ImageLoaded) LIKE "%system.management.automation%")
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic V
Monitoring for PSHost* pipes is another interesting way to find PowerShell execution



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| Named Pipe | Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | Process created Pipe | 17 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, Hostname, Image, PipeName
FROM sdTable
WHERE Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
    AND EventID = 17
    AND lower(PipeName) LIKE "\\\\pshost%"
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic VI
The "PowerShell Named Pipe IPC" event will indicate the name of the PowerShell AppDomain that started. Sign of PowerShell execution



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| Powershell | Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational | Application domain started | 53504 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, Hostname, Message
FROM sdTable
WHERE Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational"
    AND EventID = 53504
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

## Known Bypasses


## False Positives
None


## Hunter Notes
* Explore the data produced in your environment with the analytics above and document what normal looks like from a PowerShell perspective.
* If execution of PowerShell happens all the time in your environment, I suggest to categorize the data you collect by business unit to build profiles and be able to filter out potential noise.
* You can also stack the values of the command line arguments being used. You can hash the command line arguments too and stack the values.
