# Remote Service creation


## Metadata

## Hypothesis
Adversaries might be creating new services remotely to execute code and move laterally in my environment


## Technical Context
None


## Offensive Tradecraft
Adversaries may execute a binary, command, or script via a method that interacts with Windows services, such as the Service Control Manager. This can be done by by adversaries creating a new service.
Adversaries can create services remotely to execute code and move lateraly across the environment.

## Analytics


### Initialize Analytics Engine

```python
from openhunt.mordorutils import *
spark = get_spark()
```

### Download & Process Security Dataset

```python
sd_file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OTRF/Security-Datasets/master/datasets/atomic/windows/lateral_movement/host/empire_psexec_dcerpc_tcp_svcctl.zip"
registerMordorSQLTable(spark, sd_file, "sdTable")
```

### Analytic I
Look for new services being created in your environment under a network logon session (3). That is a sign that the service creation was performed from another endpoint in the environment



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| Service | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | User created Service | 4697 |
| Authentication log | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | User authenticated Host | 4624 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT o.`@timestamp`, o.Hostname, o.SubjectUserName, o.SubjectUserName, o.ServiceName, a.IpAddress
FROM sdTable o
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT Hostname,TargetUserName,TargetLogonId,IpAddress
    FROM sdTable
    WHERE LOWER(Channel) = "security"
        AND EventID = 4624
        AND LogonType = 3            
        AND NOT TargetUserName LIKE "%$"
    ) a
ON o.SubjectLogonId = a.TargetLogonId
WHERE LOWER(o.Channel) = "security"
    AND o.EventID = 4697
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

## Hunter Notes
* If there are a lot of unique services being created in your environment, try to categorize the data based on the bussiness unit.
* Identify the source of unique services being created everyday. I have seen Microsoft applications doing this.
* Stack the values of the service file name associated with the new service.
* Document what users create new services across your environment on a daily basis
