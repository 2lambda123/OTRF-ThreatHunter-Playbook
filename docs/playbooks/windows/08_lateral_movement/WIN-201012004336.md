## Hypothesis
Adversaries might be creating a file remotely via the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol.


## Technical Context
Client systems use the Common Internet File System (CIFS) Protocol to request file and print services from server systems over a network. CIFS is a stateful protocol, in which clients establish a session with a server and use that session to make a variety of requests to access files, printers, and inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, such as named pipes.
The extended CIFS Protocol is known as the Server Message Block (SMB). The SMB2 CREATE Request packet is sent by a client to request either creation of or access to a file. In case of a named pipe or printer, the server MUST create a new file.


## Offensive Tradecraft
Adversaries leverage SMB to copy files over the network to either execute code remotely or exfiltrate data.

## Analytics


### Initialize Analytics Engine

```python
from openhunt.mordorutils import *
spark = get_spark()
```

### Download & Process Security Dataset

```python
sd_file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OTRF/Security-Datasets/master/datasets/atomic/windows/lateral_movement/host/covenant_copy_smb_CreateRequest.zip"
registerMordorSQLTable(spark, sd_file, "sdTable")
```

### Analytic I
Look for non-system accounts SMB connecting (Tree Connect) to a file share that is not IPC$.



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| File | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | User accessed file share | 5140 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, Hostname, ShareName, SubjectUserName, SubjectLogonId,  AccessMask
FROM sdTable
WHERE LOWER(Channel) = 'security'
    AND (EventID = 5140)
    AND NOT ShareName LIKE '%IPC$'
    AND NOT SubjectUserName LIKE '%$'
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic II
Look for non-system accounts SMB connecting (Tree Connect) to an IPC$ Share and administrative shares (i.e C$) with the same logon session ID.



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| File | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | User accessed file share | 5140 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, Hostname, ShareName, SubjectUserName, b.SubjectLogonId, IpAddress, IpPort
FROM sdTable b
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT SubjectLogonId
    FROM sdTable
    WHERE LOWER(Channel) = "security"
        AND EventID = 5140
        AND ShareName LIKE '%IPC$'
        AND NOT SubjectUserName LIKE '%$'
    ) a
ON b.SubjectLogonId = a.SubjectLogonId
WHERE LOWER(b.Channel) = 'security'
    AND b.EventID = 5140
    AND b.ShareName LIKE '%C$'
    AND NOT SubjectUserName LIKE '%$'
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic III
Look for non-system accounts SMB accessing a file with write (0x2) access mask via administrative share (i.e C$).



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| File | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | User accessed File | 5145 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, Hostname, ShareName, SubjectUserName, SubjectLogonId, IpAddress, IpPort, RelativeTargetName
FROM sdTable
WHERE LOWER(Channel) = "security"
    AND EventID = 5145
    AND ShareName LIKE '%C$'
    AND NOT SubjectUserName LIKE '%$'
    AND AccessMask = '0x2'
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic IV
Look for non-system accounts SMB connecting (Tree Connect) to an IPC$ Share and administrative shares (i.e C$) and accessing/creating a file with write (0x2) access mask with the same logon session ID.



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| File | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | User accessed file share | 5140 |
| File | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | User accessed File | 5145 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, Hostname, ShareName, SubjectUserName, d.SubjectLogonId, IpAddress, IpPort, RelativeTargetName
FROM sdTable d
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT b.SubjectLogonId
    FROM sdTable b
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT SubjectLogonId
        FROM sdTable
        WHERE LOWER(Channel) = "security"
            AND EventID = 5140
            AND ShareName LIKE '%IPC$'
            AND NOT SubjectUserName LIKE '%$'
    ) a
    ON b.SubjectLogonId = a.SubjectLogonId
    WHERE LOWER(b.Channel) = 'security'
        AND b.EventID = 5140
        AND b.ShareName LIKE '%C$'
) c
ON d.SubjectLogonId = c.SubjectLogonId
WHERE LOWER(d.Channel) = 'security'
    AND d.EventID = 5145
    AND d.ShareName LIKE '%C$'
    AND d.AccessMask = '0x2'
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic V
Look for files that were accessed over the network with write (0x2) access mask via administrative shares (i.e C$) and that were created by the System process on the target system.



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| File | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | User accessed File | 5145 |
| File | Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | Process created File | 11 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, Hostname, ShareName, SubjectUserName, SubjectLogonId, IpAddress, IpPort, RelativeTargetName
FROM sdTable b
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT LOWER(REVERSE(SPLIT(TargetFilename, '\'))[0]) as TargetFilename
    FROM sdTable
    WHERE Channel = 'Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational'
        AND Image = 'System'
        AND EventID = 11
) a
ON LOWER(REVERSE(SPLIT(RelativeTargetName, '\'))[0]) = a.TargetFilename
WHERE LOWER(b.Channel) = 'security'
    AND b.EventID = 5145
    AND b.AccessMask = '0x2'
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

## Hunter Notes
* Baseline your environment to identify normal activity. Document all accounts creating files over the network via administrative shares.
