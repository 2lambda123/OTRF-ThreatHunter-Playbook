## Hypothesis
Adversaries might be leveraging WMI eventing for persistence in my environment.


## Technical Context
WMI is the Microsoft implementation of the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) and Common Information Model (CIM). Both standards aim to provide an industry-agnostic means of collecting and transmitting information related to any managed component in an enterprise.
An example of a managed component in WMI would be a running process, registry key, installed service, file information, etc.
At a high level, Microsoft implementation of these standards can be summarized as follows > Managed Components Managed components are represented as WMI objects â€” class instances representing highly structured operating system data. Microsoft provides a wealth of WMI objects that communicate information related to the operating system. E.g. Win32_Process, Win32_Service, AntiVirusProduct, Win32_StartupCommand, etc.


## Offensive Tradecraft
From an offensive perspective WMI has the ability to trigger off nearly any conceivable event, making it a good technique for persistence.

Three requirements
* Filter - An action to trigger off of
* Consumer - An action to take upon triggering the filter
* Binding - Registers a FilterConsumer

## Analytics


### Initialize Analytics Engine

```python
from openhunt.mordorutils import *
spark = get_spark()
```

### Download & Process Security Dataset

```python
sd_file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OTRF/Security-Datasets/master/datasets/atomic/windows/persistence/host/empire_wmi_local_event_subscriptions_elevated_user.zip"
registerMordorSQLTable(spark, sd_file, "sdTable")
```

### Analytic I
Look for WMI event filters registered



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| WMI object | Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | User created Wmi filter | 19 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, Hostname, User, EventNamespace, Name, Query
FROM sdTable
WHERE Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
    AND EventID = 19
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic II
Look for WMI event consumers registered



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| WMI object | Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | User created Wmi consumer | 20 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, Hostname, User, Name, Type, Destination
FROM sdTable
WHERE Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
    AND EventID = 20
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic III
Look for WMI consumers binding to filters



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| WMI object | Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | User created Wmi subscription | 21 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, Hostname, User, Operation, Consumer, Filter
FROM sdTable
WHERE Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
    AND EventID = 21
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```

### Analytic IV
Look for events related to the registration of FilterToConsumerBinding



| Data source | Event Provider | Relationship | Event |
|:------------|:---------------|--------------|-------|
| WMI object | Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational | Wmi subscription created | 5861 |

```python
df = spark.sql(
'''
SELECT `@timestamp`, Hostname, Message
FROM sdTable
WHERE Channel = "Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational"
    AND EventID = 5861
'''
)
df.show(10,False)
```
