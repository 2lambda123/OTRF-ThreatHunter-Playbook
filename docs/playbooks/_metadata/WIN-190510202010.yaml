hypothesis: Adversaries might have updated the property value UseLogonCredential of HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest to 1 in order to be able to extract clear text passwords from memory contents of lsass.
technical_context: |-
  Windows 8.1 introduced a registry setting that allows for disabling the storage of the users logon credential in clear text for the WDigest provider.
offensive_tradecraft: |-
  This setting can be modified in the property UseLogonCredential for the registry key HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest.
  If this key does not exists, you can create it and set it to 1 to enable clear text passwords.
